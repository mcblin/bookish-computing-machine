# Barker Code Optimizer

This repository contains MATLAB code that optimizes a Barker code to minimize its side lobes. Barker codes are sequences of either +1 or -1 that are widely used in radar, sonar, and communications due to their favorable auto-correlation properties. Reducing side lobes in these codes can lead to better performance in signal processing applications.

## Code Description

The main goal of this code is to find the best Barker code with the lowest possible side lobes. The code optimizes the Barker code using a brute-force approach by iterating through all possible sequences of +1 and -1 and calculating their side lobes using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The sequence with the lowest side lobes is then considered the "best" Barker code.

The code performs the following steps:
1. Initializes the code length, which is set to 5×13×13×13.
2. Defines a function `side_lobe` to calculate the side lobes of a given Barker code.
3. Iterates through all possible values of +1 and -1 for the Barker code.
4. Calculates the side lobes for each candidate code.
5. Keeps track of the code with the lowest side lobes as well as its corresponding side lobes value.
6. Prints the best Barker code and its minimal side lobes to the MATLAB console.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

3. Run the script by executing it in MATLAB.

4. The code will output the best Barker code found and its corresponding minimal side lobes.
